                        Very friendly and helpful.
                        Picked up our pup Bobby up a couple of weeks ago.
                        At 9 weeks he’s already toilet trained and 
                        has learnt the commands sit, paw, down and stay. Thank you again.

                        We picked our Finley from 2 weeks of age and 
                        every week up until we picked him up we got 
                        photos and telling us how his week went and 
                        also visited him again before picking him up. 
                        They are such knowledgeable breeders and answered 
                        any questions I had. He gets so many compliments 
                        and is such a delight to have he is also willing 
                        to learn quick and understands the training well.

                        We got our German shepherd puppy January 2023, 
                        She is a darling and the breeders are 100% 
                        lovely and professional. They sent me loads of 
                        photos before picking up the puppy and let me 
                        come to see her whenever I liked. They take good 
                        care of their dogs and treat them like Queens and 
                        Kings. My puppy is very confident and food driven. 
                        Thank you so much &#129392; <br><br> Amy and Jack x

                        We bought our German Shepherd puppy with Hiams in Jan 2022.
                        After a bad time with our last pup, the whole experience 
                        was brilliant. Before picking our pups up, we were sent 
                        constant update and pictures. On picking our pup up we 
                        were given all of the documents needed and you can tell 
                        how brilliant the care the dogs receive. We saw the mum. 
                        Our pup is now a year old and is gorgeous, so healthy. 
                        We would definitely recommend Hiams Hounds to anyone.

                        Very helpful with the purchase of our puppy. Saw mum and dad.
                        Very sociable puppy. Mum was calm and sociable. 
                        Would recommend.

                        From my very first contact with Hiams Hounds, they were 
                        friendly and helpful. They were interested to know that 
                        I was an experienced German Shepherd owner. They let me
                        know when the pups were born, sent me pictures right from 
                        birth to when I collected him, and were very friendly 
                        and accomodating when I went to view the pups and then 
                        pick mine up. The pups were beautiful, strong, and healthy
                        puppies, raised in a lovely environment. When I got my 
                        puppy home, he was so relaxed and confident, exploring 
                        in the garden and playing with his toys. I would absolutely
                        recommend Hiams Hounds for great service and beautiful, 
                        healthy pups.

                        Nellie has been with us for a while now. She has developed 
                        her own personality which goes from "leave me alone" to 
                        " I love you, give me a cuddle pls". She is so unbelievably 
                        clever which makes us so proud of her. She has the heart 
                        and bravery of a lion, but a tickle on her belly turns her 
                        into a pussy cat. She has changed our lives so much it is 
                        impossible to explain. you will never know how meeting you, 
                        and you providing us with the greatest thing that has ever 
                        happened to us has changed our lives forever. 
                        Thank you for Nellie.
